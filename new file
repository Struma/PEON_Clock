This project was inspired by a childhood of feeling shame and finally realizing it was because I was poor. Now I say don't believe a system that tells you that it is your fault that you can't afford your education or medical debts because you are too poor.

Come one come all! For I have made a very special clock, and I have made it for us to enjoy.

I have made a timepiece that I am calling a PEON Clock - PEON which stands for Personal Economic Offering to the Nation - and it is no ordinary clock.

This timepiece is a must have for any individuals or families caught in the throws of poverty and debt servitude! This clock is fun and ready to run on debt, but has specifically tuned to resonate with the suffering of crushing medical or student loan debt.

At the heart of the PEON Clock is software written in python3 that uses tk and pyGubu to display the clock information on screen. PyGubu is a tool for rapid tk prototyping and it works well. I did notice some issues with the functionality of bindings and poor documentation, but I am happy to report that all pyGubu issues that I had could be resolved directly by hard-coding some tk.

The PEON Clock interface uses information from a serialized list of values stored locally as a json in a file called "PEON_conf". The python3 list is structured as follows

GoldenYoke = [ timeOfDeath, debt, monthlyPayments, 
​             interestRate, mugShot, clock_theme ]

​

 


These values, and the PEON profile image, can be set using the helper script "PEON_Config.py". The clock updates from the json file nightly at 12am making it possible to incorporate web scraping and other tools to update the debt and interest information into the clock.
